Additionally, these tools incorporate:
- [MCP servers](https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/mcp-server): MCP servers act as a bridge between the
Gemini model and your local environment or other services like APIs.
- [Sandboxing](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/sandbox): Sandboxing isolates the model and its
changes from your environment to reduce potential risk.
