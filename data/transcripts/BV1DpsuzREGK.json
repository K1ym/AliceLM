He smiled and, He knew my name.🎼Oh of the wheels, our worlds collectide, a fleeting morning between threeside.He s with the river subway homes, which bow his where he's from his gaze meets mind.And the world stands still us far being night against small will, strangers with flowers on a crowded train, He smiled in me.He knew my name in the home of the films, our worlds collective life a leading moment which dreams reside What his story.🎼co不 never。😊fresh time slows forward to the chance encounter.Pa in you strangest rip flowers on a crowded train.🎼부도 유의 협약이 적용 된 이후.",
